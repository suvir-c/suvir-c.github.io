        <h3>Hi, I'm Suvir!</h3>
        <p>
        I'm a programmer from Issaquah, Washington, currently studying at USC in Los Angeles.
        <br />I love creating things, reading about tech and philosophy, and listening to and learning about music.
        <br />You can reach me at scoppara@usc.edu.

        <h3>Projects I'm proud of</h3>
           <b>Spark SC</b> is an organization at USC dedicated to enabling the entrepreneurial spirit in others, helping students find the people, inspiration, and creative confidence to work on the projects they are most excited about. I was on the leadership team last year and helped recruit bright new members, organize a dozen committees around this mission, and push our board to achieve as much impact as possible. You can learn more <a href="https://sparksc.org/">here</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>USC Hackers</b> is an initiative I worked on to help USC students of all backgrounds work on technical projects they were interested in. A few friends and I befriended a friendly coffee shop owner on campus to host weekly hack nights with our own mentors, snazzy <a href="http://usc-hacker-orientation.glitch.me/">invites</a>, and cold brew coffee.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've also interned at <b>Square</b>, where I developed features for <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/software/point-of-sale">Square Point of Sale</a>. This summer I'll be interning on <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/capital">Square Capital</a>.
            <br />
        <h3>People I've enjoyed learning from</h3>
            <b>Andrew Kortina's</b> blog (founder of Venmo and Fin) melds philosophical and technological ideas using really interesting media.
            <br />Some of my favorites are his <a href="https://kortina.nyc/about-andrew-kortina/">bio</a> and this <a href="https://kortina.nyc/essays/the-emperor-has-no-clothes-there-is-no-santa-claus-and-nothing-is-rocket-science/">piece</a> about technological determinism and what made Venmo special.
            <br />
            <br /><b>David Kempe's</b> randomized algorithms course at USC challenged my assumptions about algorithm design and got me really interested in computer science theory.
            <br />I especially loved learning about applications of random walks and Markov Chains.
            <br />
            <br /><b>Tim Urban</b> has written loads of articles on his blog, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com">waitbutwhy</a>, about technology, politics, careers, and lots more.
            <br />His <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">piece</a> on brain computer interfaces changed how I think about technological progress and the future.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>and many, many other people I've been lucky to meet or read content from online...</b>
        <h3>Art that I love</h3>
        <b>Consider the Lobster</b> by David Foster Wallace is a book of satirical essays that I love. I also love this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI">commencement speech</a> by dfw.
            <br />
            <br />This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tctzUNMp5po">rehearsal</a> of <b>If Not For You</b> by George Harrison is one of my favorite live performances.
            <br />
            <br />I made this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1240381987/playlist/2OIqv6HV0hDx6mZIa01ykc?si=HHSDGdbDT1m8VQXj-aPwoQ">playlist</a> of songs I like from movies, and songs that would be in my movie if I made one. Listening to soundtracks is one of my favorite parts of watching movies.
